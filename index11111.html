  <p> Health is Wealth app, would help a user in setting up a health routine on a daily basis based on the time they get up.
      The user is prompted to enter their waking up time. Based on this, the application would by default, unless changed
      would prompt user to get a glass of water after every 2 hours, prompting user to have a minimal 8 glasses of water
      per day. Similarly, the application would remind user to go for a small walk after some default set of time unless changed.
      Another thing that the application does, would be considering the user would wake up the next day around the same time,
      suggesting him to get 8 hour sleep, by 'go to bed' reminders.
    <br>
    <br>
      There are apps that take care of the above individually. The major advantage here would be, the application will make
      users' schedule more disciplined.
